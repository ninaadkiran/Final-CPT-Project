# Tri 3 Personal CPT

This is my personal project. The frontend was coded by me with the help of Chat GPT for some of the more repetitive tasks such as creating CSS or some functions that were purely javascript and weren't connected to my backend in any way.

The backend was coded by me using my teacher's code for reference.

This project has evolved a chatroom that I created in the previous trimester into a chatroom with algorithmic features to search things based on certain criteria and sort by alphabetical order.
